Problem Statement

Manual attendance tracking in educational institutions is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to maintain. There is no simple system for adding students, marking their attendance, and generating accurate attendance reports. A lightweight digital solution is required to automate the attendance workflow using basic Java concepts.

Scope of the Project

The project covers:

Adding and managing student information

Recording daily attendance (Present/Absent)

Storing data in CSV files for persistence

Generating per-student attendance percentages

Viewing daily attendance sheets

Running the system entirely through a console-based interface

This project focuses on core Java, file handling, and modular design, without GUI or database integration (which can be added later).

Target Users

School/College Teachers

Coaching Institutes

Small academic centers needing simple attendance tracking

Students learning Java who want to understand file handling and modular programming
